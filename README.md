# Othello
This program is a simple yet beautiful Electron app to play the popular strategy game Othello. You can learn more about the game [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi#Othello).

## How do I install it?
There are three ways you can get this program.
- [Download the binary](https://github.com/w-henderson/Othello/releases) (recommended)
- [Play in a browser](https://w-henderson.github.io/Othello)
- Clone the repo, install dependencies, then run `npm start`

## Features
This version of Othello features two modes, one where you can play against someone on the same computer, and another where you can play against a very basic AI. If you've ever looked into Othello strategies, you'll easily beat the AI, but less skilled players such as myself will have a hard time beating it! The program also features a stylish user interface with slick animations and a responsive feel.
